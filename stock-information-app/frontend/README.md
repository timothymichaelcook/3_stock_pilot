## Description

- Our goal was to create an interactive Stock Exchange application using the MERN stack   format, with a user-friendly and intuitive interface. The application features secure user authentication for access control, ensuring data privacy and security. We utilized modern front-end technologies such as React and Bulma, and robust back-end technologies including Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB for efficient data management and processing. Our application is designed to provide real-time stock data updates, delivering a seamless and engaging user experience.
